# student-directory #

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb *filename*
```
Replace *filename* with any list of students you'd like. Default file format is .csv. If no file name provided, the program will try to load students.csv.
Each line in the file should contain a student's name and cohort month as a symbol, separated by a comma.

Follow onscreen instructions to add to, remove from, sort, load, or save a directory.
